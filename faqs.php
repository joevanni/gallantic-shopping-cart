<h2 >Ormolu</h2>
<div><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;font-size: 15px;">Ormolu is the most proper term used when describing bronze that has been gilded with gold.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;">This  also usually refers to "mercury gilded" or what some call in slang terms "fire gilded. Regarding bronze bronze  prior to being gilded each 18th century caster developed his own formula for a perfect ratio of components, which he kept top secret. In general the main component is copper, which varies between 82 and 91%.</span>
	
  <br /><br />
 <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;font-size: 15px;">Mercury gilding was the finist of quality when it comes to object in bronze to be finished with gold.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;">
  The process was invented during the 17th century and continue through the early to mid 19th century. A variation of the process, known as matt-gilding, was invented in the 18 century. The reason mercury gilding came about was the bronze smiths were havinga difficult time finding a way to melt a layer of gold onto the bronze surface without using to much gold(being quite costly in any amount) and also trying not to re-heat the bronze work itself risking melting or dulling of the details.</span>
 <br /><br />
 
  <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;font-size: 15px;">The mercury process involved mixing and amalgam paste like consistency of mercury(liquid metal) and powdered gold.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;"> This was then brushed onto the bronze surface to be glided with a wire brush and a nice even amount could be used not wasting any gold. But the real genius of the process was the entire work of art need  only be heated or "fired" at low temperatures. The original bronze work itself was not at risk for damage or melting but the temperature was hot enough to drive away all the mercury which turned into fumes leaving only the gold on the surface.</span>
  <br /><br />
  <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;font-size: 15px;">No other methodof gilding bronze gave as rich an effect, but it was costly in human life as well as the quantity of gold used.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;"> The mercurous oxide fumes driven off in the process are highly noxious and in the 18th Century many workers and craftsman perished from 'fossy law', a disease caused by mercury-gilding. In 1816 Ravrio bequeathed 3,000 francs as a prize for the inventor of a process that would protect craftsmen from the harmful vapours. It was awarded to d'Arcet of the Paris mint, who devised a new type of oven. Although this altered method of mercury gilding was invented it was still harmful although not as great as in the original manor in which the craft was done. mercury gilding was eventualy outlawed and banned due to the dangerous fumes the mercury produced during the firing process.</span>
   <br /><br />
  <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;font-size: 15px;">Later methods of using electric current were developed to gild bronze objects and some exceptional items were still able to be created with rich matte gilding and burnished areas of highlight but even so the newer methods did not produce as fine a quality of gilding as the earlier examples created during the 18th century and early 19th century.</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Sans', 'DejaVu Sans', Verdana, sans-serif;"> The newer methods of electro gilding also used very small amounts of gold cutting the costs down greatly. this fact also played a hand in the larger amount of gilt bronze that could be produced at lower cost starting in the mid 19th century. This also explains the great difference in price between Objects from the "Period" rather than in the "Style Of" which are later manufactures of similar works with the Electro
 Gilding. </span></div>
